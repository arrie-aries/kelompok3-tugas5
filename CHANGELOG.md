# Tank U! Changelog

## [v1.1.0] Update on Reward Condition
Instead of total win, we're updating the reward condition using player level. Now, you can get a new Tank Skin every 2 levels. </br>
For our precious player from the early version, don't worry because your collected skin will be saved if you're upgrading from 1.0.5. So, if you are plying in lower version than 1.0.5, consider to open it first in 1.0.5 version. Enjoy!
